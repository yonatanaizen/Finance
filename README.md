# Finance 
It is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that contain Python code on stocks to help investors make better decisions
### Update   
In this file, I created a matrix that contains the current price of a stock and also determines its change
### Stock Distribution and Prediction
In this file, I create and simulate a normally distributed random variable. In the second part, I create a multivariate normal variable and simulate it. Lastly, I perform a bootstrap simulation. At the end of the file, I develop a Dash app that provides the user with the option to select a stock and 'N' days. The app displays a graph of the closing price accompanied by two prediction graphs: one derived using the bootstrap method and the other based on the normal distribution method. Additionally, the app presents a summary table with the mean of the stock, standard deviation (SD), and sequence.
